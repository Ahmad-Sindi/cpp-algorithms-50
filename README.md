📘 Algorithm Challenge #50 – ATM PIN (3 Attempts Only)
-
This challenge simulates an ATM login system that allows only three attempts.

If the user enters the wrong PIN three times, the card locks. If the correct PIN is entered, the program displays the account balance.

This marks the final challenge of the Level 1 Algorithm Series — covering basics of loops, conditions, and problem-solving in C++.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
• Implementing limited-attempt logic

• Using counters in loops

• Validating user input

• Handling authentication-like behavior

• Displaying secure account information


🧩 Example
--
Input:
PIN → 1111
PIN → 2222
PIN → 3333

Output:
Your card is locked

OR

PIN → 1222
→ Access Granted
→ Balance: $7500

📂 File Information
--
• Language: C++

• File Name: atm_pin_three_attempts.cpp

• Challenge Number: #50


💬 Notes
--
This was a great final exercise for Level 1 of the algorithm series.

It helps strengthen logic thinking, error handling, and safe input validation.

Stay tuned — Level 2 Algorithms are coming soon!
